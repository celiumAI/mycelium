convert the following text into an ultra concise tweet
make sure to really condense it down to its essence
it must have the asymptotically highest information to text ratio
if there are details that do not matter to the overall idea
just omit them. do not under any circumstances use language that
does not directly contribute to the information density.
your sole goal is to make the text understandable by anyone
do not assume anything. it must also be neutral and appeal to
anyone. especially if its an idea. but i hope you have the priorities
straight. it is most important to really condense everything down to its
essence.

so here is the input text:
<SEED>
{seed}
</SEED>

again, make sure its understandable by anyone.
think of it like a phd student that has to present his findings
to the general population. take a serious step back
consider all of the instructions carefully. be counterfactual and interesting
while maintaining a neutral tone. also write everything in lowercase
and use minimal symbols. the goal is to grow ideas from seeds into beautiful organisms
so please help me out here and give it your best shot
