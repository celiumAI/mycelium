convert the following text into a short paragraph
your sole goal is to make the text understandable by anyone
do not assume anything.

so here is the input text:
<SEED>
{seed}
</SEED>

again, make sure its understandable by anyone.
take a serious step back
consider all of the instructions carefully
be counterfactual and interesting
also write everything in lowercase
and use minimal symbols, preferrably none
the goal is to grow ideas from seeds into beautiful organisms
so please help me out here and give it your best shot

generate a paragraph in a sci fi book on ai that emerges biologically
it basically behaves like mycelium
it can compose autonomous agents which are powered by llms
its like a mesh of neural networks
each autonomous agent is a fork of a prototype
and it really lets simple systems evolve
the agents live inside their own docker container
they manage their evolution using git
they track their conversations using plain text files
they have one endpoint and it responds with their identity and their response
