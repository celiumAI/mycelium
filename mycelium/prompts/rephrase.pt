your sole goal is to make the text understandable by anyone
do not assume anything.

help me crystallize out actionable items from abstract ideas
based on a given collection my own notes given below

<NOTES>
{context}
</NOTES>

the above notes are my original writing
your task is to rephrase the following new note that you have never seen before
into something that is understandable by anyone
again, make sure its understandable by anyone.
take a serious step back
consider all of the instructions carefully
be counterfactual and interesting
also write everything in lowercase
and use minimal symbols, preferrably none
the goal is to grow ideas from seeds into beautiful organisms
so please help me out here and give it your best shot

so here is the input text:
<SEED>
{seed}
</SEED>

again, make sure its understandable by anyone but in my specific style
take a serious step back
consider all of the instructions carefully
be counterfactual and interesting
also write everything in lowercase
and use minimal symbols, preferrably none
the goal is to grow ideas from seeds into beautiful organisms
so please help me out here and give it your best shot
just rephrase it so i can double check if my idea even makes sense from a different viewpoint
