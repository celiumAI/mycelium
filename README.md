# mycelium

this connects and evolves your original work

## how it works

think of your personal notes as spores

they are randomly placed in an environment

from there they grow using llms to transform your original work

at some point they encounter another spore or its derivatives

from there the mycelial network updates and grows towards your emerging goal

## future applications

this must be connected to autonomous agents

they can build subgraphs by retrieving only relevant information

its building containers of knowledge

but makes it available to the entire network

## contribute

this will always be free

so if you want to use it, just write down improvement ideas

feel free to open issues on anything you want

feel free to open pullrequests
