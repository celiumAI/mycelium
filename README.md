# note

this just helps you have all your notes in one location

it also will get a lot of llm features to help you with publishing your ideas

it will use workflows and scripts and apis and just work

## how it works

install note

you just need to type `note` in your command line

and then just type out your idea or thought or whatever you want to note

for now it will just be written to the $HOME/notes/seeds directory

they serve as the seeds for whatever comes out of the ideas

## plugins

this is literally the easiest way to write plugins:

1. write a function that can be anywhere and take the note seed string as an input
2. do an arbitrary manipulation to it
3. define the plugin filepath
4. let it write to that filepath
