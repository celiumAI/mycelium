# note

this just helps you have all your notes in one location

it also will get a lot of llm features to help you with publishing your ideas

it will use workflows and scripts and apis and just work

## how it works

install note

you just need to type `note` in your command line

and then just type out your idea or thought or whatever you want to note

for now it will just be written to the $HOME/notes/seeds directory

they serve as the seeds for whatever comes out of the ideas
